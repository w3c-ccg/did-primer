A Decentralized Identifier (DID) is a new type of identifier that is
globally unique, resolvable with high availability, and cryptographically
verifiable. DIDs are typically associated with cryptographic material, such
as public keys, and service endpoints, for establishing secure communication
channels. DIDs are useful for any application that benefits from
self-administered, cryptographically verifiable identifiers such as
personal identifiers, organizational identifiers, and identifiers for
Internet of Things scenarios. For example, current commercial deployments of
W3C Verifiable Credentials heavily utilize Decentralized Identifiers to
identify people, organizations, and things and to achieve a number of
security and privacy-protecting guarantees. This document is an introduction
to the concept of Decentralized Identifiers.

  <section>
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>At a superficial level, a <strong>decentralized
    identifier</strong> (<strong>DID</strong>) is simply a new type
    of globally unique identifier. But at a deeper level, DIDs are
    the core component of an entirely new layer of decentralized
    digital identity and public key infrastructure (PKI) for the
    Internet. This <a href=
    "https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">
    <strong><em>decentralized public key
    infrastructure</em></strong></a> (DPKI) could have as much
    impact on global cybersecurity and cyberprivacy as the
    development of the <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security"><em>SSL/TLS
    protocol</em></a> for encrypted Web traffic (now the largest
    PKI in the world).</p>
    <p>This primer is designed to give newcomers to DID
    architecture the background they need to understand not just
    the DID specification, but the overall architecture for
    decentralized identity represented by the family of DID-related
    specifications currently under development. It covers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Background on the origin of DIDs and the DID
        specification.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How DIDs differ from other globally-unique
        identifiers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How the syntax of DIDs can be adapted to work with
        decentralized networks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How DIDs resolve to <strong>DID Documents</strong>
        containing public keys and service endpoints.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The key role that <strong>DID Methods</strong> play in
        the implementation of DID infrastructure.</p>
      </li>

        <p>Privacy considerations for the use of DIDs.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How DID infrastructure lays the foundation for

    <h2 id=
    "how-dids-differ-from-other-globally-unique-identifiers">How
    DIDs Differ from Other Globally Unique Identifiers</h2>
    <p>The need for globally unique identifiers that do not require
    a centralized registration authority is not new. <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier"><em>
    UUIDs</em></a> (Universally Unique Identifiers, also called
    GUIDs, Globally Unique Identifiers) were developed for this
    purpose in the 1980s and standardized first by the Open
    Software Foundation and then by <a href=
    "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122"><em>IETF RFC
    4122</em></a>.</p>
    <p>The need for persistent identifiers (identifiers that can be
    assigned once to an entity and never need to change) is also
    not new. This class of identifiers was standardized as <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name"><em>URNs</em></a>
    (Uniform Resource Names) first by IETF <a href=
    "https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt"><em>RFC 2141</em></a>
    and more recently by <a href=
    "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141"><em>RFC
    8141</em></a>.</p>
    <p>As a rule, however, UUIDs are not globally resolvable and
    URNs – if resolvable – require a centralized registration
    authority. In addition, neither UUIDs or URNs inherently
    address a third characteristic – the ability to
    <strong>cryptographically verify ownership of the
    identifier</strong>.</p>
    <p>For <strong>self-sovereign identity</strong>, which can be
    defined as a lifetime portable digital identity that does not
    depend on any centralized authority, we need a new class of
    identifier that fulfills all four requirements: persistence,
    global resolvability, cryptographic verifiability, and
    decentralization.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2 id="the-format-of-a-did">The Format of a DID</h2>
    <p>In 2016 the developers of the DID specification agreed with
    a suggestion from Christopher Allen that DIDs could be adapted
    to work with multiple blockchains by following the same basic
    pattern as the URN specification:</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="did-primer-diagrams/urn-format.png" alt=
      "urn:uuid:fe0cde11-59d2-4621-887f-23013499f905">
      <figcaption>
        urn:uuid:fe0cde11-59d2-4621-887f-23013499f905
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The key difference is that with DIDs the namespace component
    identifies a <strong>DID method</strong>, and a <strong>DID
    method specification</strong> specifies the format of the
    method-specific identifier.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="did-primer-diagrams/did-format.png" alt=
      "did:example:12345abcde">
      <figcaption>
        did:example:12345abcde
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>DID methods (further explained below) define how DIDs work
    with a specific blockchain. All DID method specs must define
    the format and generation of the method-specific identifier.
    Note that the method specific identifier string
    <strong>must</strong> be unique in the namespace of that DID
    method.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2 id="did-documents">DID Documents</h2>
    <p>DID infrastructure can be thought of as a global <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-value_database"><em>key-value
    database</em></a> in which the database is all DID-compatible
    blockchains, distributed ledgers, or decentralized networks. In
    this virtual database, the key is a DID, and the value is a
    <strong>DID document</strong>. The purpose of the DID document
    is to describe the public keys, authentication protocols, and
    service endpoints necessary to bootstrap
    cryptographically-verifiable interactions with the identified
    entity.</p>
    <p>A DID document is a valid <a href=
    "https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/"><em>JSON-LD
    object</em></a> that uses the <strong>DID context</strong> (the
    RDF vocabulary of property names) defined in the DID
    specification. This includes six components (all optional):</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p><strong>The DID itself</strong>, so the DID document is
        fully self-describing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>A set of cryptographic material</strong>, such
        as public keys, that can be used for authentication or
        interaction with the DID subject.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>A set of cryptographic protocols</strong> for
        interacting with the DID subject, such as authentication
        and capability delegation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>A set of service endpoints</strong> that
        describe where and how to interact with the DID
        subject.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Timestamps</strong> for auditing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>A optional JSON-LD signature</strong> if needed
        to verify the integrity of the DID document.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>See the <a href=
    "https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/"><em>DID
    specification</em></a> for several examples of DID
    documents.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2 id="did-methods">DID Methods</h2>
    <p>DIDs and DID documents can be adapted to any modern
    blockchain, distributed ledger, or other decentralized network
    capable of resolving a unique key into a unique value. It does
    not matter whether the blockchain is public, private,
    permissionless, or permissioned.</p>
    <p>Defining how a DID and DID document are created, resolved,
    and managed on a specific blockchain or “target system” is the
    role of a <strong>DID method specification</strong>. DID method
    specifications are to the generic DID specification as URN
    namespace specifications (UUID, ISBN, OID, LSID, etc.) are to
    the generic IETF URN specification (<a href=
    "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141"><em>RFC
    8141</em></a>).</p>
    <p>DID method specifications typically define at least the
    following operations for a particular target system:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p><strong>Create.</strong> Some DID methods may generate a
        DID directly from a cryptographic key pair. Others may use
        the address of a transaction or a smart contract on the
        blockchain itself.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Read.</strong> Some DID methods use blockchains
        that can store DID documents directly on the blockchain.
        Others may instruct DID resolvers to construct them
        dynamically based on attributes of a blockchain record.
        Still others may store a pointer on the blockchain to a DID
        document stored in one or more parts on other decentralized
        storage networks such as <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System"><em>
        IPFS</em></a> or <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STORJ"><em>STORJ</em></a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Update.</strong> The update operation is the
        most critical from a security standpoint because control of
        a DID document represents control of the public keys or
        proofs necessary to authenticate an entity (and therefore
        for an attacker to impersonate the entity). Since
        verification of DID document update permissions can only be
        enforced by the target blockchain, the DID method
        specification must define precisely how authentication and
        authorization are performed for any update operation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Delete.</strong> DID entries on a blockchain are
        by definition immutable, so they can never be “deleted” in
        the conventional database sense. However they can be
        <strong>revoked</strong> in the cryptographic sense. A DID
        method specification must define how this termination is
        performed, e.g., by writing a null DID document.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>See the <a href=
    "https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/">DID Method
    Registry</a> for a complete list of all known DID Method
    specifications.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2 id="dids-and-privacy-by-design">DIDs and Privacy by
    Design</h2>
    <p>Privacy is an essential component of any identity management
    solution; it is especially critical for a global identity
    system that uses immutable public blockchains. Thankfully DID
    architecture can incorporate <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design"><em>Privacy
    by Design</em></a> at the very lowest levels of infrastructure
    and thus become a powerful, new, privacy-preserving technology
    if deployed using best practices such as:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p><strong>Pairwise-pseudonymous DIDs.</strong> While DIDs
        can be used as well-known public identifiers, they can also
        be used as private identifiers issued on a per-relationship
        basis. So rather than a person having a single DID, like a
        cell phone number or national ID number, she can have
        thousands of pairwise-unique DIDs that cannot be correlated
        without her consent, yet can still be managed as easily as
        an address book.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Off-chain private data.</strong> Storing any
        type of PII on a public blockchain, even encrypted or
        hashed, is dangerous for two reasons: 1) the encrypted or
        hashed data is a global correlation point when the data is
        shared with multiple parties, and 2) if the encryption is
        eventually broken (e.g., <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing"><em>quantum
        computing</em></a>), the data will be forever accessible on
        an immutable public ledger. So the best practice is to
        store all private data off-chain and exchange it only over
        encrypted, private, peer-to-peer connections.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Selective disclosure.</strong> The decentralized
        PKI (DPKI) that DIDs make possible opens the door to
        individuals gaining greater control over their personal
        data in two ways. First, it enables it to be shared using
        encrypted digital credentials (see below). Second, these
        credentials can use <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof"><em>zero-knowledge
        proof cryptography</em></a> for <a href=
        "https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/03/16/why-data-minimization-is-an-important-concept-in-the-age-of-big-data/">
        <em>data minimization</em></a>, e.g., you can disclose that
        you are over a certain age without disclosing your exact
        birthdate.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2 id="dids-and-verifiable-credentials">DIDs and Verifiable
    Credentials</h2>
    <p>DIDs are only the base layer of decentralized identity
    infrastructure. The next higher layer – where most of the value
    is unlocked – is <strong>verifiable credentials</strong>. This
    is the technical term for a digitally signed electronic
    credential that conforms to the interoperability standards
    being developed by the <a href=
    "https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/charter.html"><em>W3C Verifiable
    Claims Working Group</em></a>.</p>
    <p>DIDs can be used to identify various entities in the
    Verifiable Credentials ecosystem such as issuers, holders,
    subjects, and verifiers. More generally, DIDs can be used as
    identifiers for people, devices, and organizations.</p>
